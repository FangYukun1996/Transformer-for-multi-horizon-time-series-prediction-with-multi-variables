# Transformer-for-multi-horizon-time-series-prediction-with-multi-variables
A modified Transformer model for multi-horizon time series prediction with multi variables  
Using Keras API and the TensorFlow edition is 2.6
The 'utils.py' contains the basic components to construct a Transformer for time series prediction task.
The 'train.py' presents the process of construct the Transformer using Keras and the process of training.
The 'test.py' presents how to predict the future time series.

More details will be implemented...
